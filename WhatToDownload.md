Starting with ver 0.8.002, we presently have 3 types of zip files in the download area, named according to the following pattern:

  * (1) use-boxer-and-borj-0.8.002.zip  - this is a binary distribution, including compiled BOXER and BORJ code (as a JAR file),  necessary third-party libraries (Xerces Jars), and documentation

  * (2) sample-data-for-boxer-and-borj-0.8.002.zip - Sample data sets for BOXER and BORJ

  * (3) boxer-and-borj-source-0.8.002.zip -    Source code for BOXER and BORJ , and documentation

The source code in (3) can be used to rebuild the binary distribution in (1). So you can download either (1) and (2), or (2) and (3). It probably makes most sense to unpack both packages (or all three, if so desired) in the same directories, so the 2 or 3 subdirectories named use-boxer-and-borj-0.8.002 and/or boxer-and-borj-source-0.8.002, and
sample-data-for-boxer-and-borj-0.8.002, will be created.

There is also a file named like this:

  * (4) boxer-0.8.002.zip

This is just a snapshot of the source directory, and is kept at the Downlaod area primarily for the developers' convenience. "Officially" you are supposed to download (2) and (3) instead, because they are better organized.
