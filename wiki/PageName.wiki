#Using Google Code

= Introduction =

To put the code in, one apparently needs to install a Subversion (SVN) client locally. 
For an MS Windows machine, trying to get "CollabNet Subversion Client v1.6.3"  from here: http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#windows

= Details =

*Adding* a whole tree (once-off):
 * svn import src  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src  --username vmenkov   -m "Initial import"

*Deleting* a file:
 * svn del  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boxer/BXRReader.java.bak  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boxer/DataPoint.java.bak --username vmenkov -m "delete bak files"

*Checking out*:
 * svn co https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boxer/src/boxer src/boxer --username vmenkov

(If you are not "vmenkov", use your own Google name instead)

That will check out an entire directory src/boxer on your host.

*Committing*:

Once you've made changes to files, you commit the whole tree:
* svn commit src/boxer

*Adding* a file:

If you have added a new file, e.g. "add" it before committing like this:
* svn add src/boxer/doc-files/my-new-doc.html
